# I-CHAT-APPLICATION

BY:-Rohan Prajapati

For this application first of all create a project in the firebase and get the JSON file to copy in the android studio where my project file is exist, then I copy all necessary implementation link from firebase and past Gradle file and connect the firebase. Then I design the UI for the user sign-in page and login activity page and another activity.

Currently supported features and TODOs:

 Firebase email login
 Exchanging messages with other registered/authenticated users
 Filter users based on their name
 Fragment to edit the main information of a user
 Upload and exchange images with others
 End-to-end encryption (a. only one device involved and b. multiple devices involved)
 Maybe redo email sign in to use a custom UI instead of the FirebaseAuthUI
 Create user groups based on interests etc. and filter based on these
